This repository contains the source for my personal website, built with [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com).  
The site shares research notes, data workflows, and exploration-focused thinking shaped by northern landscapes, geoscience practice, and reproducible methods.

## Features

- Custom About page  
- Newsletter collection  
- Portfolio sections  
- Reproducible, evidence‑grade publishing workflow  
- Clean, minimal Jekyll configuration  

## Philosophy

The site reflects an approach to exploration grounded in rural Canadian roots, spatial reasoning, environmental awareness, and transparent data practices.  
It also incorporates work in **Generative Mineral Exploration**, combining structured data, geostatistics, and computational tools to support early‑stage decision‑making.

## Credits
