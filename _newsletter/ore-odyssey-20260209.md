### Banyan Gold Corp.

Releases drill core assay results for the AurMac Au Project, Mayo, YT, Kaska, Liard, Daylu Dena

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong>

'Open down-dip and at depth' lacks geological context. Figure 1's Au Grade (g/t) x Interval (m) mixes grade and distance inconsistent with an MRE. Figures 3 & 5-7 lack assay values or ranges. Core size, sample length, prep method, assay weight, QA/QC insertion rate, and QA/QC verification method are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade.

### Kutcho Copper Corp.

Provides an overview of the Kutcho Cu-Zn Project, Tatl'ah (Dease Lake), BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong>

CuEqR lacks an equation and parameters. 'High conductivity', 'conductivity high anomalies', and 'conductivity anomaly' lack intensity values or ranges. 'Multiple' lacks metrics. '>', 'significant copper and zinc geochemical soil anomaly', 'drill surface copper occurrences', and 'anomalous copper and zinc values' lack assay values or ranges. 'Defined with footprints large enough' - ZTEM conductivity targets lack volume/depth validation due to inversion non-uniqueness, limited depth resolution beyond 1-2 skin depths (~500m), and inability to measure true thickness - a small, highly conductive object (like a narrow vein of metal) can produce the exact same signal as a large, weakly conductive object (like a wide zone of salty water or clay). Figures 4 & 5 lack a base map legend. Chip sample weight, core size, sample length, true width, prep & assay method, geophysical survey parameters, and a QA/QC description are missing.
