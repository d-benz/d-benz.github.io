Provides an update and details for 2026 exploration plans at the Keno Ag Project, Mayo, YT, Na-Cho Nyäk Dun

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong>

Gram-meter (“GxM”) multiplies grade (g/t) by down-hole length (m), risking confusion with tonnage via length scaling, and omits typical MRE factors such as true width, geometallurgy, density, and economics. 'Multiple multi-gram gold intercepts up to', 'shallow', 'numerous wide, high-grade intercepts', 'broad silver-lead-zinc geochemical anomalies' lack metrics. Figure 2's 'soil anomalies (above 5 g/t AgEq)' lacks assay results and mixes grades, commodity prices, and recovery for a sample media unlikely to be mined. 'Remain open for expansion' lacks geological context. 'Based on the contained Ag Eq ounces outlined in the 2024 MRE, this equates to approximately 1,000 Ag Eq ounces per meter drilled' is inconsistent with an MRE. Ag Eq g/t equation uses borrowed recoveries: 'based on recoveries at similar nearby operations.' Figure 3's 'OPEN' lacks geological context. Soil horizon, soil sample depth, sample weight, core size, core sample length, aqua regia and multi-acid assay weights, and QA/QC verification results are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade.
