Provides 2025 field program highlights for the Alturas West Ag-Au-Sb-Cu-Pb Project, New Denver, BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong>

Rock samples and 'historical polymetallic samples' lack type (outcrop, float, mine dump grab). 'Very low Ti, V, Sr, and Th' and 'up to' lack assay values or ranges. Sample weight, assay weight, and  QA/QC verification results are missing. 2024 drill interval lacks a 'from' distance.

### Snowline Gold Corp.

Reports additional drill core assay results for the Rogue Au Project, Ross River, YT

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong>

Grab sample type is missing (outcrop, float). 'Higher grade', 'lower grade', 'visible gold', 'up to', and 'elevated Bi, Cu, Fe, Pb, Sn, Te & Zn values' lack assay values or ranges. 'Multiple outcrops' lacks metrics. Figures 2 & 3 lack a rock sample type (outcrop, float) and mixes media assay results ('Soils & Talus Fines'). Figure 4 lacks a lithology legend. Soil horizon, soil sample depth, sample weight, QA/QC insertion rate, and QA/QC verification results are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution.
