<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'Open' lacks geological context. 'Magnetic signature' lacks intensity values or ranges. Figure 2 legend is missing a <DL value. Soil horizon, soil sample depth, sample weight, prep method, assay weight, percentile method, and a QA/QC description are missing. The cited Geoscience BC project (Report 2022-07, “Identification of New Porphyry Potential Under Cover in British Columbia,” project 2018-047) is described as using geophysical modelling to build an overburden thickness model and identify porphyry targets; it is not described by Geoscience BC as an artificial-intelligence or machine-learning study.
