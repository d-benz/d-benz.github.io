### Banyan Gold Corp.

Reports drill core assay results for the AurMac Au Project, Mayo, YT, Na-Cho Nyäk Dun

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

Highlight intervals lack 'from' distances. 'Near-surface' lacks distance. Figure 1's Au Grade (g/t) x Interval (m) mixes grade and distance inconsistent with an MRE. Figures 2, 4, & 6 lack assay values or ranges. Figures 3, 5, & 7 lack Stratigraphy code descriptions and 'Open' lacks geological context. Core sample length, prep method, 4-acid & metallic screen assay weights, and QA/QC verification results are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade.

### Golden Sky Minerals Corp.

Releases the results of an heli-borne magnetic geophysical survey on the Rayfield-Gjoll Cu-Au Project, 70 Mile House, BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'Magnetic lows', 'moderate magnetic response', and 'magnetic anomalies' lack intensity values or ranges. 'Up to' and 'elevated' lacks assay values or ranges. 'Multiple' lacks metrics. Figures 1-4 lack a TMI legend. Soil horizon, soil sample depth, soil sample spacing, sample weight, core size, core sample length, true width, collar table, prep & assay method, geophysical survey parameters, and a QA/QC description are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade.

### Hecla Mining Company

Continues definition drilling at the Keno Hill Ag-Zn-Pb Project, Mayo, YT, Na-Cho Nyäk Dun

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'Open in multiple directions' lacks geological context. Intercepts lack 'from' distances. 'Upgrading the resource' and 'expanding the resource' lacks an updated MRE. Core size, core sample length, true width, collar table, prep & assay method, QA/QC insertion rate, and QA/QC verification results are missing.

### Inomin Mines Inc.

With Sumitomo Metal Mining, announces exploration plans for the Beaver-Lynx Ni-Mg-Co-PGE Project, McLeese Lake, BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'Confirmed a large nickel-magnesium-cobalt-PGE system' lacks an MRE. 'Intersected chromium, copper, silver, and gold' lacks assay values or ranges. 'Multiple' and 'several' lack metrics. 'Defined by magnetic surveys, appear as large or larger’ – magnetic targets lack volume/depth validation due to inversion non-uniqueness, limited depth resolution, and inability to measure true thickness. A small, highly magnetic body at depth (e.g., a narrow magnetite-rich vein) can produce essentially the same magnetic anomaly as a much larger, weakly magnetic body closer to surface (e.g., a broad zone of weakly magnetized rock). 'May host large volumes' lacks supporting information.

### Kutcho Copper Corp.

Announces drilling targets on the Kutcho Cu-Zn Project, Tatl’ah (Dease Lake), BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'High-grade' lacks assay values or ranges. 'Multiple' lacks metrics. 'Conductivity  highs' lack intensity values or ranges. 'An area more than double the current known Mineral Resource' - conductivity targets lack volume/depth validation due to inversion non-uniqueness, limited depth resolution beyond 1-2 skin depths (~500m), and inability to measure true thickness - a small, highly conductive object (like a narrow vein of metal) can produce the exact same signal as a large, weakly conductive object (like a wide zone of salty water or clay). E062 interval lacks a 'from' distance. 'Maximum anomalous copper value' lacks assay values or ranges. Core size, sample length, true width, collar table, prep & assay method, geophysical survey parameters, and a QA/QC description are missing.
