### Canada One Mining Corp.

Reports rock sampling assay results for the Copper Dome Au-Ag-Cu Project, Princeton, BC, Smelqmix

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

Rock lacks sample type (outcrop, float). 'Elevated iron levels' lacks assay values or ranges. Figure 2 lacks rock sample types (outcrop, float). Sample weight, prep method, ME-MS61 assay weight, historical methods, and a QA/QC verification description are missing.

### Coast Copper Corp.

Announces Audio-Magnetotelluric (AMT) geophysical survey results for the Copper Kettle Cu-Mo Project,Port Hardy, BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'Reveals a significant underlying intrusion beneath' – AMT results are interpretations of resistivity contrasts and do not directly determine rock types; they can also overestimate the size of an anomaly due to 'resistivity smearing' or may represent non-mineralized resistive units (like silicified zones). 'Porphyry systems' lacks MREs. 'Magnetic high' lacks intensity values or ranges. 'Up to' and 'reaching' lacks assay values or ranges. Rock lacks sample type (outcrop, float). 'Shallow conductive' and 'larger resistive' lack metrics. Soil horizon, soil sample depth, soil sample spacing, sample weight, core size, core sample length, true width, collar table, prep & assay method, geophysical survey parameters, 'CuEQ' equation & parameters, and a QA/QC description are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade.

### Enduro Metals Corporation

Releases surface sampling assay results for the October Dome Au-Cu Project, Likely, BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'One third of rock samples' lack sample type (outcrop, float). Figure 3 lacks Rock sample type (outcrop, float). 'Well defined and robust copper and gold soil geochemical anomaly' and 'strong magnetic and chargeability anomalies' lack metrics. Soil sample depth, soil sample spacing, sample weight, rock sieve size, assay weights, soil interpolation method, core size, sample length, collar table, and a QA/QC description are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade.

### Sasquatch Resources Corp.

Executes an asset purchase agreement to acquire mineral tenures for Cu exploration near Port Alberni, BC

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

Map 1 lacks tenure boundaries. Photograph 1 shows rusty-coloured boulders on the downhill (right) side of the road and smaller oxidized rocks with yellow-stained soil on the uphill (left) side - because BC resource roads are typically built by cutting into uphill material and placing larger rocks downslope, oxidized material appearing on both sides indicates that rusty material occurs in the area, although its continuity or depth beneath overburden cannot be determined solely from the material along a road. Photographs 2 - 4 lack assay values or ranges. 'Significant volumes' lacks metrics. 'Both mining waste and recent logging road construction may present an opportunity to find easily accessible and potentially mineral-rich waste rock' - mining waste and logging road construction offer surface-level accessibility to geological material; however, mining waste contains pre-processed material with known mineral associations, whereas logging road outcrops provide fresh geological exposures that require new sampling to determine grade and subsurface volume. Processing historical tailings or waste rock often transfers the environmental liability of the entire site to the new operator.

### Sitka Gold Corp.

Commences a 60,000 m diamond drill program at the RC Au Project, Dawson City, YT

<div class="note-block">
<strong>Note:</strong><br>

'Open in all directions' lacks geological context. 'Consistent gold mineralization', 'gold-in-soil anomaly', 'up to', 'significant tungsten', and 'higher-grade' lacks assay values or ranges. 'Intersected gold mineralization over a 900 m x 650 m area' and 'all of which have been shown to host intrusion-related gold mineralization' lack metrics and is inconsistent with an MRE. 'Known gold deposits' lacks metrics. Figure 3's 'OPEN' lacks geological context. Soil horizon, soil sample depth, soil sample spacing, sample weight, soil interpolation method, core size, sample length, true width, collar table, prep & assay method, and a QA/QC description are missing. Intervals are without a Maximum Internal Dilution and a minimum grade. Figures 2 & 4's Drill Hole legend shows yellow at 0.1 Au g/t, whereas the 'Notable deposits in the belt' resources are at 0.3, 0.57, 1.11, 0.63, 1.21, and  1.67 g/t Au; the Jan 2025 gold cutoff for the MRE at Blackjack is 0.3 g/t Au.
