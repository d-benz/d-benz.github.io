subtitle: Exploration, data, and stewardship shaped by rural Canadian roots
---

Takom Exploration is more than a name — it reflects a lineage of hands‑on work, land‑based knowledge, and a long-standing commitment to responsible mineral exploration. This perspective is rooted in a family history woven through British Columbia’s resource sector: heavy equipment operators who helped build the Boss Mountain Mine, welders and mechanics at the Highland Valley Copper Mine, and generations shaped by the landscapes of the Interior — from hotel owners supporting the BC gold rush to trappers, forestry support crews, and sawmill workers. These rural Canadian roots inform an approach to exploration that values practical experience, environmental awareness, and respect for the land.

With 30 years of experience across mineral exploration, earth sciences, biology, and geostatistics, my work focuses on building **transparent, reproducible, evidence‑grade workflows** for exploration and environmental data. This includes a growing specialization in **Generative Mineral Exploration** — using structured data, spatial reasoning, and computational tools to surface patterns, hypotheses, and insights that support early‑stage decision‑making.

Generative mineral exploration is a disciplined way of combining:

- spatial and geostatistical analysis  
- reproducible data and reporting pipelines  
- early environmental awareness  
- field‑grounded interpretation  
- integration of diverse datasets into clear, defensible insights  

The goal is simple: help explorers make better decisions by understanding both the resource potential and the land that holds it.

This site shares research notes, workflows, and exploration‑focused thinking shaped by northern landscapes and scientific practice. It reflects a belief that responsible exploration is built on clarity, stewardship, and a deep respect for the places where we work.
